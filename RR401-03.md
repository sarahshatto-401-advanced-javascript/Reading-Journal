## **VOCAB TERMS**
* **Database**: A container that holds various types of data, and can be categorized differently, depending on the type of database you select. 
* **Data model**: 
* **CRUD** Create, Read, Update and Delete. Describes a complete application.
* **Schema** A "style guide" for the specific set of rules that determines what data will be accepted into the database. 
* **Sanitize** Using prepared statements to protect the database from malicious input
* **Structured Query Language** SQL 
* Non SQL (NoSQL): A database that is not relational between tables. 
* **MongoDB** A non-relational database, short for "humungous". Databases in the No SQL world, no tables, but collections. It collections, we have documents- they are the rows within your tables, appear to look like jSON, they don't use the same schema. You can have multiple documents within the same table using different fields. No relations within collections collections with documents- all of your information lives within one collection. Less relations going on, but a risk of duplicated data. 
* **Mongoose** Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling library for MondoDB and Node.js. It manages the relationships between data, provides schema validation, and can translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. 
* **Record** Essentially the rows within your tables when using a SQL database.
* **Document**  a NoSQL version of records
* **Object Relation Mapping** Object Relational Mapping is a way for our Javascript programs to manage database data by "mapping" database tables to classes and instances of classes to rows in those tables.


## **QUESTIONS** 
1. **Why would a developer choose to make data models?**
    * Data Models are a visual representation of how data interacts with the various pieces of it's given system. 
2. **What purpose do CRUD operations serve?**
    * Create: Entering in new data into the database
    * Read: Query the database for information that exists
    * Update: Make changes to existing information within the database
    * Delete: Remove information from the database
3. **What kind of database is PostGres? What kind of database is MongoDB?**
    * PostGres is a relational database, MongoDB is noSQL. 
4. **What is Mongoose and why do we need it?**
    * Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling library for MondoDB and Node.js. It manages the relationships between data, provides schema validation, and can translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. 
5. **Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each product has a Category and belongs in a Department.**
    *  Three related pieces of data in a possible application:
        * Clothes, Women's, and Trend Brands. Clothes would be the broadest category, containing women's, men's and kids clothes. Women's would only hold clothes that women were interested in, and Trend brands would hold a specific set of clothes that are deemed "in" or "in trend". 


## **RESOURCES**
* MLab: remotely hosted mongoDB systems. Easily setup a free database (or pay for more horsepower). Works great with Heroku
* Atlas: Cloud based, highly scalable Mongo DB
* DynamoDB: AWS NoSQL Database. Very highly scalable. Also provides a ‘mongoose’-like ORM called ‘dynamoose’
* CosmosDB: The Microsoft Azure equivalent for Atlas and Dynamo


    *SQL: Structured Query Language*
        Ex: SELECT id, name,price FROM products
        * A database we typically use is a relational database - a database that works within certain assumption. It works with tables. A table is like a bin or storage container. In SQL world, we query data with SQL and we have very strict requirements for what data is stored in our database tables as defined in the schema file. A Schema is like a style guide for your data that's about to be entered- strict rules that hold the boundaries of adheres to your overall database. Schema is defined by fields. Ex: in a products table, we would have multiple fields that might live in there like id, name, price, and description. Everything that we would enter as a new record will have a value that falls under one of the preset fields. Can't have more fields than the preset fields. Things are completely uniform.
        * Since the Schema is so restrictive, we have to normalize our input format so that it adheres to the schema fields you've listed.
        * Multiple tables are all related. Ex. Orders, Users, and Products.
        * multiple types of relations within SQL: one to one, one to many, or many to many.
    * MongoDB: short for "humongous" because it's built to store lots of data in an efficient way.
        * Databases in the No SQL world, no tables, but collections
        * In collects, we have documents- they are the rows within your tables, appear to look like jSON, they don't use the same schema. You can have multiple documents within the same table using different fields.
        * No relations within collections 
        * collections with documents- all of your information lives within one collection.
            * Less relations going on, but a risk of duplicated data. 
    * SQL vs NoSQL: 
        * SQL ------
            * Data uses Schemas 
            * Relational between tables 
            * Data is distributed across multiple tables
            * Horizontal scaling is difficult/impossible, Vertical scaling is possible
            * Limitations for lots of read and write queries per second.
        * NoSQL ----- "what answers do I have?"
            * Schema-less
            * Very few relations 
            * data is typically merged or nested within a few collections
            * horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
            * Great for various read and write requests

* Database modeling for different database types
