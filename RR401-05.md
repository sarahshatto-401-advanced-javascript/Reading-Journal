### Linked lists:

* A linked list is a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other. Each node references the next node in the link. 
* there are two types of linked list-
    * Singly 
    * doubly
        * Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
        * Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
* Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
* Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
* Head - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
* Current - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, you typically reset the current to the head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
* Tail - a reference type of type  Node to the last node in a linked list. 






* We depend on the next value to guide us where the next reference is pointing.
* you cannot use a for or for each loop, you can use a while loop for traversing. The while loop allows us to continually check that the next node in the list is not null.
* the current node is the most helpful. Current will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are. 

        ALGORTIHM Includes (value)
        // INPUT <-- integer value
        // OUTPUT <-- boolean
            
            Current <-- Head
            WHILE Current is not NULL
                IF Current.Value is equal to value
                    return TRUE
                Current <-- Current.Next
            return FALSE

1. we are setting current to the head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning.
2. creating a while loop. Will only run if the node that is current is not null.
3. once we are in the while loop, we are checking to see if the value of the current node is equal to the value we’re looking for. If the condition is true, that would be the value we’re looking for and thus would return true.
4. if the current node does not contain the value we are looking for, we must then move current to the next node that is being referenced.
5. steps 3 and 4 repeat until the value is reached. 


big O 

Big O of time for this case for includes would be O(n). This is because at worst case, the node we are looking for will be the last node in the linked list. N represents the number of nodes in the linked list. 

Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is given to us. 

In order to add a new node with O(1) efficiency, we have to replace the current head of the linked list with the new node, without losing reference to the next node in the list. 


Steps:

1. Set current equal to head. This will guarantee we’re starting from the very beginning.
2. instantiate the new node. The values passed in as arguments into the add() method will define what the value of the node will be.
3. newNode.Next by default is set to null. We want to set newNode.Next property to the same location that Head node is pointing towards. This moves newNode to the beginning.
4. We have to reassign where head is pointing to. Reassign head to the new first node. 
Adding to the middle of a linked list
1. Create a new node, with a value of — and the next will be null because we haven’t attached it to the list yet.
2. you can use addBefore or addAfter methods.
3. we will traverse while the next node is not null. Before moving current to the next node, we check to see if the value is equal to the value we’re looking for.
Once we find the value we were searching for, we set our new node’s “.next” property to the existing node. 
“ what is a linked list, anyway? Part one”
* Data structures are different ways that we can organize our data:
    * variables
    * arrays
    * hashes 
    * objects
* linked lists:
    * linear data structures: there is a sequence and order to how they are constructed and traversed. We have to traverse through the structure sequentially. 
non linear structures can be traversed non-sequentially. 


* We can organize our data into hashes (dictionaries)
* trees and graphs are also non-linear data structures 
* both in arrays and data structures, order matters.

Arrays vs linked lists: both can store information, but in an array, you need continuous blocks of memory to store it, while linked lists can pull from different spots in the memory. They can grow dynamically.
* arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.
    *  Static structures need all of their memory to be allocated when the structure is created, so even if a structure grows or shrinks it will still always take up the same amount of memory.
    * dynamic structures can shrink and grow in memory. Size and shape can change, 
* a node only knows what data it contains and who it’s neighbor is.
* singly linked lists are the simplest types of linked list, because they only go in one direction.
* doubly linked list: there are two references contained within each node: a reference to the next node as well as the previous node.
* 


* A circular node doesn’t point to a null node. It points to another node that acts like the tail. 
You can begin traversing it from the tail node. 
* Makes it easy to add to this list. 

Part two: 

* Big O Notation: 
    * a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm. 
* There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performsL how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs. 
* A way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function. 
* External factors that affect the time it takes for a function to run: the speed of the processor, what else the computer is running, etc.. we use Big O Notation to express how quickly it's runtime grows.
* O (referred to as just "O" or sometimes "order") and a variable, n, where n is the size of the input. 
* Within linked lists and Big O notation, there are two types of equations to remember:
    * O(1)
        * takes constant time- no matter how many elements or how huge the input is, it will always take the same amount of time and memory to run this algorithm
    * O(n) 
        * linear, which means as the input grows, the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
