QUESTIONS: 

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
	- Basic authentication transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.
	- Bearer authentication (aka token authentication) has security tokens called "bearer tokens". The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.
2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
	- compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains. 
3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
	- You should not store it in plain text, only an encrypted or hash version, to help reduce the likelihood of the secret leaking. Be extra cautious in how you reveal it to subsequent developers working in the code.

VOCAB: 

- encryption
	- Using a combination of a secret and an algorithm, you can mask your private data. 
- token
	- After being authenticated, a generated token may be given to a user for a specified amount of time. This allows the user to not have to sign in multiple times. 
- bearer
	- Bearer authentication (aka token authentication) has security tokens called "bearer tokens". The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.
- secret
	- A secret known only to the app and the auth server. protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.
- JSON Web Token
	- a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret.
