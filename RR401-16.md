## QUESTIONS:
1. Why is access control important?
- Access control is important because it allows you as a developer to define roles within your application and define what roles have the ability to access the various CRUD methods. This allows for multiple users to exist and have different access to different functions.

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
- A blog or review site may have multiple roles available to a user- examples: a baseline "user" would have access only to read information, while a "writer" might be able to create, read, update, and delete. This kind of site might have a moderator, an admin, an editor, etc... all with varying access to the different functions of the site.  

3. What is a role used for?
- Each role can be individually defined with it's own level of permissions, like user accounts on a computer have different levels of access. 

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- With role based access, each user is assigned a role. That role can scale easily with permissions - you add a new area/feature, you just need to figure out the access for each role. When users sign up you grant them role access, and that way it stays consistent. Otherwise you would have to manage all permissions for all users. So that means when you add a feature that requires permission, you'd have to individually update each user for what level of access should be. Instead of individual preferences, you just assign roles to people to make it simpler. 

## DEFINE:

1. Authorization: What you are cleared to be able to do within an application. 
2. Role Based Access Control: Defining roles that give varying levels of authorization to a user. 
3. Capabilities: Different permissions given to a user depending on the role assigned to them.
