Describe and define: 
* Node and the v8 engine
* command line interface

Importing and exporting modules: (Modularization)
* If one module exports a function/object/class, another module can import and use that function or object. 
* Exporting 
Ex: // person.js
const person = {};

person.walk = function() {
  return 'walking';
}

module.exports = person;
* Importing
        const human = require('./person.js'))
    console.log( human.walk() );  // prints 'walking'

Command Line Input: 
Allow users to send our program(/application) information when they run it. You can do this with flags and parameters. 
* Examples:
    * -x  : a simple flag that an app might use as a boolean internally
    * --port 3000: a more complex flag that sends a value

node server.js -v --port 3000 



NPM notes: 
* NPM makes it easy for javascript devs to share the code that they've created to solve particular problems and for other developers to reuse that code in their own apps. Easy to update your code and allow for developers depending on that code to grab any updates you make. 
    * These chunks of code that you can create and share out to other devs via NPM are called packages (or sometimes modules), which is just a directory with one or more files within it. Will also include a package.json, which contains metadata about the package (instructions on how it is read or used)
    * Node modules : NPM started as a node package manager, node is server side. Node is an application that allows you to run javascript within the terminal without having
    * 'a node' is an object. 'node' and 'node.js' is the environment that runs the backend javaScript code. 
* 
    * "Running JavaScript inside a browser means you are interacting with Web UI (HTML and CSS components) which is displayed on a userâ€™s screen. Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs." -quora
* Node.js is used for: Servers, database management, web applications, desktop and mobile apps, robotics.
Running the node command will allow node.js to interpret javascript files, run js files
* initialize your project by running npm init in the project directory. Answer the questions, a package.json file is created, including the metadata of the project. Node.js provides a file system api. It is a built in module by invoking the require function. 
1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    * When running Javascript inside the browser, you have to then also deal with web components like HTML and CSS. 
    * Node js allows Javascript to run outside of the browser and in any platform. Any javascript code that you write will run in any system that has node.js installed, which makes it available to anyone. 
    * Browsers can impose certain limitations to your code. Working outside of a browser enables you to utilize the full strength of your code.
2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    * Modules are libraries for node.js. A package is one or more modules grouped/packaged together. 
    * A package can hold several modules within it. 
    * A module can be any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded using the require() function. 
3. What does the node package manager do?
    * NPM makes it easy for javascript devs to share the code that they've created to solve particular problems and for other developers to reuse that code in their own apps. Easy to update your code and allow for developers depending on that code to grab any updates you make. 
4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module
       1. 
        const fullName = () => {
        return 'Sarah';
        };

        exports.fullName = fullName; 

        2.
        class User {
    constructor(first, last, height){
    this.firstName= firstName; 
    this.lastName= lastName;
    this.height= height;
}

    getUserInfo(){
    return `
        firstName: ${this.firstName}
        lastName: ${this.lastName}
         height: ${this.Height}
`;
}
}

module.exports = User;

module.exports = {
    getUserInfo: () => {
    return 'Sarah';
},
}:

Vocabulary terms: 
* Ecosystem: Node.js package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
* Node.js: the environment used to read javascript outside of a browser- it allows you to interpret code with less limitations in the back end. 
* V8 Engine: an open source javascript and web assembly engine written in C++. 
* Module: Modules are libraries for node.js. 
* Package: A package is one or more modules grouped/packaged together 
* Node Package Manager: makes it easy for javascript devs to share the code that they've created and for other developers to reuse that code in their own apps. Easy to update your code and allow for developers depending on that code to grab any updates you make. 
* Server: A computer that provides data to other computers. It can serve data to the local network or the wide area network. 
* Environment: (aka platform) The state of a computer, usually determined by which programs are running and basic hardware and software characteristics. Different factors, such as operating system and other parameters that determine the environment. 
* Interpreter: Converts a high level program statement into machine code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. A compiler will convert code into machine code before the program is run, while interpreters convert code into machine code when the program is run. 
* Compiler: A program that translates the human readable code into something a computer processor understands (like binary) Compilers cannot fix errors found in that program, otherwise, it will not compile. Compilers transform code written in a programming language into machine code before the program runs, where an interpreter converts each statement, one by one, into machine code during program run. Compiled code runs faster. Displays errors after compilation
