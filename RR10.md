# Read 10: The Call Stack
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
* When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
* Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
* When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
* If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

understanding of the call stack is vital to Asynchronous programming

Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

a stack begins with the firstFunction() (which is the last function that got into the stack, and is popped out to throw the error), followed by the secondFunction(), and then the thirdFunction() (which is the first function that gets pushed into the stack when the code is executed).

When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

Manage function invocation (call): The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

Reference errors
a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs, the fact that this happens to let and const is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

Syntax errors
I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

Range errors
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

Type errors
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.most frequent error in JS, trying to access a property/method thinking that bar is of the type object when in reality, since it hasn’t been declared yet, it’s undefined which doesn’t have any baz available.
To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).

If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

adding names to your functions whenever possible so that the call stack is more readable without having to dive into each step.

Another way to see the stack trace at any given point in your code is to just write console.trace() were you want to log it.

 try to catch the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error (this fallback can be a 404 page which is normally not that graceful but is better than a page to just stop working).

using try…catch when the type checks are becoming “longer than your function logic”, when a request is made and you aren’t sure if the response might change or temporarily when a code is continuously giving you problems and you still haven’t got around to refactor it.

quokka to evaluate your code as you type
eslint to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way.
