Responsive web design

"Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference."

Mobile refers typically to building a site specifically for mobile users. preferred to just create a responsive web site. 

Responsive web design is broken into three categories: flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. 
*  flexible layouts - the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width
    * built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units
    * These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.
        * New length units specified to the viewport size of the browser: 
            * vw/vh: viewports width and height
            * vmin / vmax : minimum/maximum of the viewport's height and width
        * 
    * Formula based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it's parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element. 
        * target / context = result
    * 
    * EX: 
        *  two column layout. Below we have a parent division with the class of container wrapping both the section and aside elements. The goal is to have have the section on the left and the aside on the right, with equal margins between the two. Normally the markup and styles for this layout would look a bit like the following.
        * HTML
<div class="container">
  <section>...</section>
  <aside>...</aside>
</div>
        * CSS 
.container {
  width: 538px;
}
section,
aside {
  margin: 10px;
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 340px;
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 158px;
}
    * using the flexible grid formula we can take all of the fixed units of length and turn them into relative units. % or em
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px ÷ 538px = .018587361 */
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 63.197026%;    /* 340px ÷ 538px = .63197026 */   
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 29.3680297%;  /* 158px ÷ 538px = .293680297 */
}
    * Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size.
    * when the layout gets too small, or too large, text may become illegible and the layout may begin to break. In this event, media queries can be used to help build a better experience.
* Media queries
    * were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.
    * provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. 
    * Being able to apply uniquely targeted styles opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.
    * couple different ways to use media queries, using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document. Generally speaking it is recommend to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.

CSS
        * /* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

/* @import Rule */
@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
    * Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions. Common media types include all, screen, print, tv, and braille. 
    * Logical operators in Media Queries
        * three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.
        * Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth. 
            * Multiple individual media queries can be comma separated, acting as an unspoken or operator. 
            * The example below selects all media types between 800 and 1024 pixels wide.
        * 

@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}
The not logical operator negates the query, specifying any query but the one identified. In the example below the expression applies to any device that does not have a color screen. Black and white or monochrome screens would apply here for example.
1
2
@media not screen and (color) {...}
The only logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the HTML4 algorithm, thus hiding the styles from devices or browsers that don’t support media queries. Below, the expression selects only screens in a portrait orientation that have a user agent capable of rending media queries.
1
2
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}

        * Media features
            * Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression.
                * Orientation media feature // landscape or portrait
                * aspect ratio media feature // The value for the aspect ratio feature consist of two positive integers separated by a forward slash. The first integer identifies the width in pixels while the second integer identifies the height in pixels.
@media all and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/9) {...}
                * resolution
            * Media queries don't work with ie 8 and below
        * Mobile first technique: 
            * using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows. idea being that if you're using a mobile device with a smaller viewport, you shouldn't have to load all of the styles for a desktop experience only to have them rewritten via media queries later in the code. This would be a waste of bandwidth.
            * Also includes designing with the constraints of a mobile user in mind. 
            * downloading unnecessary media assets can be stopped by using media queries. 
            * Generally speaking, avoiding CSS3 shadows, gradients, transforms, and animations within mobile styles isn’t a bad idea either. 
                * When used excessively, they cause heavy loading and can even reduce a device’s battery life.
            * viewport meta tag:
* Flexible Media: Images, videos and other types of media need to be scalable, changing their size as the viewport changes size. 
    * quick way to do this: using the max-width property and value 100%. 
    * To get embedded media to be fully responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have a width of 100% so that it may scale based on the width of the viewport. The parent element also needs to have a height of 0 to trigger the hasLayout mechanism within Internet Explorer.
    * Padding is then given to the bottom of the parent element, the value of which is set in the same aspect ratio of the video. This allows the height of the parent element to be proportionate to that of it’s width. Remember the responsive design formula from before? If a video has an aspect ratio of 16:9, 9 divided by 16 equals .5625, thus requiring a bottom padding of 56.25%. Padding on the bottom and not the top is specifically used to prevent Internet Explorer 5.5 from breaking, and treating the parent element as an absolutely positioned element.

* Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. 
* different than page elements that use absolute positioning. 
    * Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap.
    *  Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.
* preferred method is Flexbox and Grid
