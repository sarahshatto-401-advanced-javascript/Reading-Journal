2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male.

According to a recent study conducted by Glassdoor, 11 of the 25 best-paying jobs are technology related, with an average earning potential of between $106,000 and $130,000 a year. And this trend is showing no signs of letting up: The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that employment of computer and information-technology occupations will grow by 12% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average for any other occupation.

women will not have the same access to the opportunities presented by this industry. Many of these companies blame the pipeline, citing poor enrollment and graduation rates among women in technology.

the “experience gap.” In a study she conducted in 1995, she found that among first-year computer-science students at Carnegie Mellon University, 40% of male respondents passed the advanced-placement computer-science exam, meaning they could skip the introductory-level programming class. None of the first year women achieved the same result. Men were also more familiar with programming languages than women and were more likely to report having an “expert” level of programming proficiency before enrolling at Carnegie Mellon. Unsurprisingly, many women opted out of the computer-related courses early.

Women start out so far behind that they often can’t catch up.

Even when women do have considerable experience with coding and mathematics, the male-dominated environment that has arisen becomes an obstacle to entry for many // male-dominated culture 

it is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close. Until that happens, as Ames argues, advertising will continue to drive “a subtle message to girls and women that it’s not a place where they belong.”

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. 
Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 

Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation

researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

Research also links gender representation at the executive and boardlevel with better company performance. 

Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.

Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
