# QUESTIONS : 


- Write the following steps in the correct order:
	1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
	2. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
	3. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
	4. Receive authorization code
	5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
	6. Receive access token
	7. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
- What can you do with an authorization code?
	- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- What can you do with an access token?
	- provides temporary, secure access to APIs.
- What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
	- Easier setup and more secure. 


## VOCAB : 


- Client ID: 
	- A unique ID specific to an individual user
- Client Secret
	- A secret known only to the app and the auth server. protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. 
- Authentication Endpoint
	- the endpoint on the authorization server where the resource owner logs in, and grants authorization to the client application
- Access Token Endpoint
	- where apps make a request to get an access token for a user.
- API Endpoint
	- a specified location from which API's can access the resources they need to carry out their function.
- Authorization Code
	- unique code that the user is given after logging in via a third party service. 
- Access Token
	- Once a user can be authorized, they are given an access token. The access token contains the credentials for a logged in session. It identifies the user's groups, privileges, etc...
