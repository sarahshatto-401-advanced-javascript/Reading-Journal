* Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source
* The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
* The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.
* mustache
* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object
* referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Only tags
* two braces around {{ name }}. This is Mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the ‘name’ property in the object we pass in, and replace {{ name }} with the actual value, e,g, “Sherlynn”.
* Mustache is NOT a templating engine. Mustache is a specification for a templating language.
* In general, we would write templates according to the Mustache specification, and it can then be compiled by a templating engine to be rendered to create an output.

Flexbox reading

* Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic
* give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes)
* flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow
* direction-agnostic : (regular layouts :block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based)
* Flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
* If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”.
* main axis spans across the width of a page, cross is top to bottom

* main axis – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property
* main-start | main-end – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
* main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.
* cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
* cross-start | cross-end – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
* cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.
