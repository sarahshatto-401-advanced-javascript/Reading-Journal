##SQL
* SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
* 
* relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables.
* 
* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.
* 
* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.
* 
* writing clauses to constrain the set of rows returned also allows the query to run faster due to the reduction in unnecessary data being returned.
* When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. 
* 
* SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.
* 
* SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause.
* 
* ORDER BY clause are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about.
