## QUESTIONS: 

1. Why is authentication important?
	- Authentication is proving that you are who you really say that you are. When approaching software applications with multiple roles, or certain levels of access or authorization granted, it's important for us to be able to establish a way to make sure that our intended users are the people who are able to access what we've allowed them to. 

1. Why should we be careful about storing a user’s password?
	- There are people who spend all of their time mining for customer data and information. As someone who is asking for a user to provide personal data, it is important to safeguard the data. 

1. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
	- "Hashing" is the process of converting data into a number, generated from a string of text, and encryption uses a combination of algorithms and a key to convert your message. 

1. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
	- Encryption uses algorithms and a secret key, where as encoding is easily available and therefore easier to reverse in order to discover customer data.

1. What is a token used for?
	- A token is generated for a user as a one-time use for a certain period of time. Very much like a wristband that you are given when you get into a concert, a user with a token is given a specified amount of access for a specified amount of time. 

## VOCAB: 

- authentication: 
	- Verifying that the user is who they say they are. 
- authorization
	- Various levels of access given within an application, preset. 
- encryption
	- converting sensitive data using a combination of an algorithm and a secret.
- hashing
	- process of converting data into a number, generated from a string of text
- session
	- a specified set amount of time where a user or device has access to an application. Once the session expires, it will require reauthenticating the user.
- cookie
	- text files stored on a user’s computer by a web browser, at the request of the web server. Limited to a small amount of data and can only be read by the website that created it. Used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. 
- token
	- After being authenticated, a generated token may be given to a user for a specified amount of time. This allows the user to not have to sign in multiple times. 
- Basic Auth
	- simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.
- encoding
	- the act of converting sensitive data into code.
- secret
	- A specified key, that combined with an algorithm, can encrypt sensitive data.
- cryptography
	- a division of computer science that focuses on transforming data into formats that cannot be recognized by unauthorized users
