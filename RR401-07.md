1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
    * Put will update and overwrite whatever file is identified, whereas patch will only amend the specific piece you have identified.

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
    * Postman
    * WireMock
    * Nock 

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
    * Swagger-UI is more popular than Apidoc.js
    * Both require documentation content on their implemented method as customize comment data.
    * Both allow to write documentation data in a separate resource file as .js and .json.
    * Apidoc.js has to modify documentation for each affected method if service changed. Swagger can limit changes.
    * Swagger uses plain json that could be parsed through a propgramming language, so we can take advantage of other 3rd parties in order to create http client etc... 

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
    * SOAP is a protocol, designed before REST, meant to ensure that programs built on different platforms and languages could exchange data in an easy manner. 
    * REST specifically was designed for working with components like media components, files, or objects on a specific hardware device. A restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. 

    * SOAP: 
    * * Simple Object Access Protocol:
    * * Uses service interfaces to expose functionality to client apps
    * * Needs more bandwidth for its usage
    * * only works with XML formats
    * * Cannot make use of REST 

    * REST:
    * * Representational State Transfer:
    * *  uses uniform service locators to access to the components on the hardware device. 
    * * works with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.
    * * Can make use of SOAP

Notes: 

express.js fundamentals
* Middleware: any number of functions that are invoked by the express.js routing layer before your final request handler is made. 
    * on our defined route, do something first, then pass it along to the next function. Each time we will use the request and response function of the http cycle in order to pass to whatever it is that we're handling. 
*

* 
* Middleware: a function or program or something that is going to run in between the time that the server gets the request and the time that the server sends the response out to the client. 
* runs in the order that you define it 
* https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2019-12/express-middleware-in-depth/
* In order to to start working with a node.js project
    *  you need to begin with npm init -y
        * This creates the basic package.json file with all of the default values filled in for you.
    * Install express by running npm i express
    * create a server.js file:

const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page')
})

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Users Page')
})

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server Started'))

    * This sets up a server on port 3000 that has two routes, a home page and a users page.
    * Run node server.js to start up the application. 
* Middleware functions have access to the response and request variables and can modify them or use them as needed. 
* Middleware functions also have a third parameter which is a next function. It must be called from a middleware for the next middleware to be executed. If this function is not called, none of the other middleware functions will be called.
* Controller actions have a request and response variable that are very similar to middleware. They are essentially middleware, but with no other middleware that comes after them. They are the end of the chain, which is why there are never any next calls inside the controller action.

    * Instead of using the browser to test REST functions, Use an extension called REST Client that allows you to call a REST API from VSCode.  Create a file called "___.rest"
    * 
* https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html
    * Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls. 
    * Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
        * Execute any code
        * Make changes to the the request and response object
        * End the req/res cycle
        * Call the next middleware function in the stack. 
    * If it isn't the end in the req/res stack, it needs to call next() to pass control to the next middleware function
        * Application level middleware: 
            * bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use and app.METHOD functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (Get/put/post) in lowercase.
            * Application-level middleware
        * Router level middleware worsame as app level middleware, except it's bound to an instance of express.Router()
            * router.use() and router.METHOD() functions 
            * Router-level middleware
        * Error handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four args to identify it as an error handling middleware function. (err, requires,next) 

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
        * 
        * Error-handling middleware
* These middleware and libraries are officially supported by the Connect/Express team:
            * body-parser - previous bodyParser, json, and urlencoded. You may also be interested in:
                * body
                * co-body
                * raw-body
            * compression - previously compress
            * connect-timeout - previously timeout
            * cookie-parser - previously cookieParser
            * cookie-session - previously cookieSession
            * csurf - previously csrf
            * errorhandler - previously error-handler
            * express-session - previously session
            * method-override - previously method-override
            * morgan - previously logger
            * response-time - previously response-time
            * serve-favicon - previously favicon
            * serve-index - previously directory
            * serve-static - previously static
            * vhost - previously vhost
* Body parser: 
    * Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser
* Routing: 
    * refers to how an app responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (path) and a specific HTTP request method (Get/post/patch/etc..) 
    * Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched. Route definition takes the following structure: 
    * You define routing using methods of the express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; 
        * Ex: app.get(), app.post()
        * 
        * *research app.param([name], callback) 
            * Add callback triggers to route parameters, where name is the name of the parameter or an array of them, and callback is the callback function. The parameters of the callback function are the request object, the response object, the next middleware, the value of the parameter and the name of the parameter, in that order.
            * If name is an array, the callback trigger is registered for each parameter declared in it, in the order in which they are declared. Furthermore, for each declared parameter except the last one, a call to next inside the callback will call the callback for the next declared parameter. For the last parameter, a call to next will call the next middleware in place for the route currently being processed, just like it would if name were just a string.
