* What is node? 
    * Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
        * Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.
* NPM: 
    * A package manager that comes bundled with Node. 
    * You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v.
    * Next, create a new file hello.js and copy in the following code:
    * console.log("Hello, World!");
    * This uses Node’s built-in console module to display a message in a terminal window
    * npm is also the world’s largest software registry
    * can also install packages locally to a project, as opposed to globally, on your system
    * you’ll notice a folder entitled node_modules. This is where npm has saved lodash and any libraries that lodash depends on. The node_modules folder shouldn’t be checked in to version control, and can, in fact, be re-created at any time by running npm install from within the project’s root.
    * By specifying your project’s dependencies in this way, you allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever packages it needs to run.
    * if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn). This isn’t because you need a Node back end to run these frameworks. You don’t. Rather, it’s because these frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.
    * one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server.
    * Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it.
    * If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.
    *  it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
    * Node.js even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server.
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');

        * The anonymous function is called with two arguments (requestand response). These contain the request from the user and the response, which we use to send back a 200 HTTP status code, along with our “Hello World!” message.
* PROS: 
    * Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. // You can do everything in the same language
    * Node speaks JSON
        * meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.
