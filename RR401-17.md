QUESTIONS: 

1. Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?
	- .emit(), .on(), .join()
2. Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?
	- When thinking about asynchronous  actions, the callback function has to wait on the handler. With event driven networking, you can have events occur independent of other listeners. 
3. What does an EventEmitter instance do?
	- The EventEmitter instance will emit its own 'newListener' event before a listener is added to its internal array of listeners. Listeners registered for the 'newListener' event are passed the event name and a reference to the listener being added. The fact that the event is triggered before adding the listener has a subtle but important side effect: any additional listeners registered to the same name within the 'newListener' callback are inserted before the listener that is in the process of being added.
4. When is a program’s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?
	- The call stack and event queue hold all of the operations that the interpreter will execute. The event loop keeps running continuously checking to see if the call stack is empty. 

VOCAB: 

- Observer Pattern
	- an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
- Listener
	- This tells whatever function to await another trigger before executing. 
- Event Handler
	- This code controls other events that are awaiting instructions. 
- Event Driven Programming
- Event Loop
	- The event loop keeps running continuously checking to see if the call stack is empty. 
- Event Queue
	- This is where your asynchronous code gets pushed to, and waits for the execution.
- Call Stack
	- where your code gets pushed/executed one by one as the interpreter reads your program, and gets popped out of the stack once the execution is done. 
- Emit/Raise/Trigger
	- Using these commands will essentially send out whatever you specify, will trigger 
- Subscribe
	- to be listening to another event to occur
- database
	- holds information
