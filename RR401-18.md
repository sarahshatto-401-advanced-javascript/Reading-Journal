* Websocket vs Socket.io: 
    * WebSocket is a communication protocol which provides directional communication between the client and server over a TCP connection. Open all of the time for real-time data transfer. When clients trigger requests to the server it does not close the connection on receiving the response, it persists and waits for the client or server to terminate the request. 
    * Socket.IO is a library which enables real time full duplex communication between client and web servers. It uses WebSocket for the interface. Both event driven libraries. 



VOCABULARY: 

* OSI Model: 
    * OSI stands for "Open System Interconnection" Model, a framework consisting of seven layers that work together to transmit data. The model was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing it into smaller, more understandable parts.
        * The seven layers: Physical Layer > Data Link Layer > Network Layer > Transport Layer > Session Layer > 
Presentation Layer > Application Layer

* TCP Model: 
    * A concise version of the OSI model. Four layers instead of seven. 
        * The layers are: Process/Application Layer > Host to host/Transport Layer > Internet Layer > Network Access/Link Layer

* TCP: 
    * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides apps a way to deliver and receive an ordered and error-checked stream of information packets over the network. Most commonly used protocol on the internet. 
    * When you request a web page on your browser, your computer sends TCP packets to the web server's address, asking it to send the web page back to you. The web server sends back a stream of TCP packets, which your browser stitches together to form a web page. Activities that trigger this: clicking a link, signing in, posting a comment, etc...
    * TCP packets are all tracked so that data is never lost or corrupted in transit- even if the network has an issue, files are not lost or corrupted. The tracking is done by TCP ordering the packets by numbering them. Then it error checks by having a recipient send a response back to the sender saying that it has received the message.

* UDP: 
    * User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used by apps to deliver a faster stream of information by cutting out the error-checking.
    * When a user uses UDP, Packets are sent to the recipient. The sender doesn't wait to make sure the recipient received the packet, it just keeps sending. Speed is more desirable. Often used for live broadcasts and online games. 
* Packets:
    * Bits of data. A basic unit of info in network transmission. The rules of TCP/IP require info to be split into packets that contain a chunk of data that needs to be sent as well as the destination address. Every packet has two main pieces: the packet header and the data. The header has several distinct pieces of info about the packet - the protocol being used, the length of the packet, the number of packets used to send the total data in question, the source and destination addresses, a checksum, and the time to live (TTL) data.
* Socket:  
    * A software object that acts as an end point establishing a bidirectional network communication link between a server-side and a client side program. Can also be referred to as an endpoint for interprocess communication within the OS within UNIX. Sometimes programs need a simple communication link between the client and server side. 
        * Sockets are classified as either active or passive.  
        * Active Sockets are connected with the remote active sockets through an open data connection. If this connection is closed, the active sockets at each end point is destroyed.
        * Passive sockets are not connected- they wait for an incoming connection that will start a new active socket.
    * Every port may have a single passive socket waiting for incoming connections and several active sockets each, respective to an open connection in the port. 

* What is the benefit of transforming data into packets? 
    * Splitting data up into packets allows data to be more reliably sent. Packet switching technology allows data to be routed to a destination through any number of transmission points, making the network decentralized and less reliant on specific equipment's success.  

* UDP is often referred to as a "connectionless" protocol. Why is this? 
    * Unlike TCP, UDP is quick and dirty. TCP packets contain a lot of information within the header around future error checking and links 


* Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? 
    * Yes, as long as it utilizes different ports. 


* Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
    * Yes, an application can be both a socket server and a socket connection.
