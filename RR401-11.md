QUESTIONS: 

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
    * A singleton is a single instance of a class that is instantiated when only one object is needed to coordinated actions across the system. It provides global access to that instance. 
2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
    * The idea of a design pattern is to designate a common solution that can be applied across multiple venues. A singleton pattern represents a single instance of an object. Only one can be created, no matter how many times the object has been instantiated. 
3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
    * When tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, I would first consider the problem that I would like to solve using my to-be-created library. With those ideas in hand, I would then try to identify the relationship between the software and the separate components that make up the library, as well as clearly identify where the user can input data and the responses to that data input. 
Vocab:

* Router Middleware: - middleware bound to an instance of express.Router().
* Dynamic Module Loading- loading modules based on when the app requires it.
* Singleton Pattern - The idea of a design pattern is to designate a common solution that can be applied across multiple venues. A singleton pattern represents a single instance of an object. Only one can be created, no matter how many times the object has been instantiated. 
* CRUD -> REST Method Matches: 
    * Create : POST
    * Read : GET
    * Update : PUT/PATCT
    * Delte : DELETE
* Mock Testing: Allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function, capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, etc...
