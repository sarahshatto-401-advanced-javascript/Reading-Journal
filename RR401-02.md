* Video #1 
    * Developers spend more time maintaining code than writing new code from scratch- how to focus on writing things that decrease the cost of maintenance. 
    * Typical amount of time it takes for coding to be "cost efficient" is around 4-6 weeks.
Creating cost efficient code
    1. Reproducible builds, everyone should be able to reproduce your build for troubleshooting
    2. Test driven development
    3. Refactoring // Evolutionary Design
    4. Keep it simple, not using trend code.
Context: 
* what the value of "this" is within your code. 
* by default, console.log(this) is the window object.
    * all global javascript objects, functions and variables automatically become members of the window object. 
    * In JavaScript, all function bodies have access to the "this" keyword. The "this" keyword is the context of the function execution. 
    * The "this" keyword is the context of the function execution. By default, "this" is a reference to the object on which a particular function is called (in Javascript all functions are bound to an object). We can use "call" and "apply" to change this binding at runtime.
* In the default, the root scope, the concept is this.
    * Three methods of changing javascript context: call, apply, and bind. 
    * call: changes the context to ... ex: obj.foo.call(window, 1,2,3); 
    * apply: very similar to call, but only takes two arguments: the context, and the second argument has to be an array. 
    * bind: takes one argument, it returns a bound function.

MDN: 
* Javascript remains prototype-based. When it comes to inheritance, javascript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object is called a prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of it's own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. (null has no prototype and acts as the final link in the this prototype chain.) 
    * Prototype and prototype chaining: 
        * Nearly all objects in JavaScript are an instance of an object. All the objects in Javascript inherit the properties and methods from object.prototype
Questions to answer: 

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
    1. Forces you to think through what you want the app to do before you write a single line of code. 
    2. More modularized extensible code means more successful code
    3. Quicker updating and troubleshooting
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
    1. beforeEach() and afterEach() both can test a multitude of elements at once. 
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
    1. More time consuming in the front half before code is actually written. 
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    1. Classes basically replace constructors and can also have static methods that are bound to the class. With classes, we can use super calls, instance and static methods, subclasses, etc..
5. Name a use case for a static method
    1. A static method is something you can call without instantiating the class. When you create a method that does not access an instance property, you use the static keyword. It can only be accessed on the Class definition itself. Useful for utility methods that do not contain any state. When you don't want to create an instance of the class, this is useful
6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves.
    1. If we had an array of numbers and wanted to create a new array that contains double of the value of the first array- without a higher order function you would have to store the first array into a variable, assign the second variable an empty array, and use a for loop to iterate through the length of the first array and for each iteration- pushing the number multiplied by two into the second array. Using a higher-order function like .map(), we only need to store the first array in a variable, and set the second array as equal to array1.map, returning a function that multiplies each item in array1 by 2.
Vocabulary: 

1. Functional programming: relies on expressions and declarations rather than statements. Value outputs in FP depend only on the arguments passed to the function.
2. Pure function: Given the same input will always return the same output with no side effects. They are the simplest reusable blocks of code in a program. Completely independent of an outside state. Easy to move around, refactor, and recognize. 
3. Higher-order function: Functions that receive another function as an argument or returns the function as an output. Examples: .map(), 
4. Immutable state: If a function were to mutate a property or object or array parameter, that would change the state that is accessible outside of the function. For example, modifying an existing array would change the original array, 
5. Object: Containers for data values. 
6. Object-Oriented programming (OOP)
7. Class:Classes in JS are templates for building objects. They encapsulate that data with code to work on that data, to add properties/attributes/values and actions/methods to that class that can be instantiated 
8. Prototype: A method that is only accessible when you create an instance of the class. 
9. super: Keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent. Must be used before the "this" keyword is used. 
10. Inheritance: A way for one class to extend to another class. 
11. Constructor: A method for initializing an instance of the class. Whenever we create a new instance of the class, it will reach into the constructor.
12. Instance: An object created using a particular constructor function.
13. Context: Object based, the value of "this" keyword, which is a reference to the object that "owns" the currently executed code. 
14. This: Operates uniquely within Javascript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode. 
    * In most cases, the the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.
15. Test Driven Development: The method of writing out tests stating what you want your code to do before you start to actually code, then writing the minimal amount of code to satisfy your test, and then refactoring. 
16. Jest: Javascript testing framework. 
17. Continuous Integration (CI) : the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control. 
18. Unit Test: Test a single part of your implementation. No dependencies, integrations, or framework specifics. 


Random notes that I'm enjoying: 

* A function is a process which takes some input, called arguments and produces some output referred to as a return value. Functions can do the following: 
    * Mapping: Produces some output based on the inputs you give to it. It maps input values to output values. 
    * Procedures: A sequence of steps. 
    * I/O: Communicate with other parts of the system (the screen, system logs, or network)
