1. Why would a developer choose to make data models? 
- To visualize the relationship between different entities within an application. 

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
-  Create, Read, Update and Delete

3. What kind of database is Postgres? 
What kind of database is MongoDB?
- Postgres is a SQL database, relational, while MongoDB is a NoSQL database. 

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it? 
- It seems like the key to understanding and communicating with MongoDB- It manages the relationships between data/schema/overall translation. 

5. Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally.
- Horizontal Scaling is when you scale by adding more machines to your pool of resources. 

6. Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases.
- When considering which type of database to choose, there are benefits on both sides. A relational database has the ability to join tables and understand the relationships between the data, whereas noSQL databases are meant for high volume while still maintaining speed since they can pool multiple resources together. 

7. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
 - Clothes, Women's, and Trend Brands. Clothes would be the broadest category, containing women's, men's and kids clothes. Women's would only hold clothes that women were interested in, and Trend brands would hold a specific set of clothes that are deemed "in" or "in trend". 

8. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
- AWS 
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud

VOCABULARY TERMS
* database: A container that holds various types of data, and can be categorized differently, depending on the type of database you select. 
* data model:
* CRUD: Create, Read, Update and Delete. Describes a complete application
* schema: A "style guide" for the specific set of rules that determines what data will be accepted into the database. 
* sanitize: Using prepared statements to protect the database from malicious input
* Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL 
* Non SQL (NoSQL): A database that is not relational between tables. 
* MongoDB: A non-relational database, short for "humungous". Databases in the No SQL world, no tables, but collections. It collections, we have documents- they are the rows within your tables, appear to look like jSON, they don't use the same schema. You can have multiple documents within the same table using different fields. No relations within collections collections with documents- all of your information lives within one collection. Less relations going on, but a risk of duplicated data. 
* Mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling library for MondoDB and Node.js. It manages the relationships between data, provides schema validation, and can translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. 
* record: Essentially the rows within your tables when using a SQL database.
* document: a NoSQL version of records
* Object Relation Mapping (ORM): Object Relational Mapping is a way for our Javascript programs to manage database data by "mapping" database tables to classes and instances of classes to rows in those tables.



    1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
    * Data Models are a visual representation of how data interacts with the various pieces of it's given system. 
* What purpose do CRUD operations serve? 
    * Create: Entering in new data into the database
    * Read: Query the database for information that exists
    * Update: Make changes to existing information within the database
    * Delete: Remove information from the database
* What kind of database is PostGres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
    * PostGres is a relational database, MongoDB is noSQL. 
* What is Mongoose and why do we need it? 
    * Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling library for MondoDB and Node.js. It manages the relationships between data, provides schema validation, and can translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. 
* Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
 Three related pieces of data in a possible application:
* Clothes, Women's, and Trend Brands. Clothes would be the broadest category, containing women's, men's and kids clothes. Women's would only hold clothes that women were interested in, and Trend brands would hold a specific set of clothes that are deemed "in" or "in trend".

Http: the protocol every web developer must know - part one

- [HTTP Drawing- URL Breakdown](./HTTP2.png) 

* Http stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
    * Stateless
    * application-layer protocol for communicating between distributed systems
* basics
    * Allows for communication between a variety of hosts and clients, supports a mixture of network configurations.
        * This makes http a stateless protocol
    * Usually takes place tcp/ip. The default port for tcp/ip 80, but other ports can also be used 

- [REST Drawing](./REST1.png) 

* Communication between a host and a client occurs via a request and response pair.
    * Client initiates an http request message - which is serviced through a http response message in return 
    * http/1.1 is the current protocol version
* urls:
    * The request message. 
    * URL: uniform resource locators.


* Protocol is typically http, but you can use https for secure communications
* the resource path is the local path to the resource on the server
* URLs reveal the identity of the particular host that we want to communicate, but the action needed to communicate are called verbs:
    * GET: fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all of the necessary info the server needs to locate and return the resource.
    * POST: create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource. 
    * PUT: update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource. 

DELETE: delete an existing resource. 

- [HTTP Drawing- Request/Response](./HTTP1.png) 

* New HTTP verbs: 
    * HEAD: similar to GET, without a message body. Retrieves server headers for a particular resource, generally to see if the resource has changed
    * TRACE: Used to retrieve the hops that a request takes to round trip from the server. Each intermediate proxy or gateway would inject its IP or DNS name info the via header field.
* OPTIONS: used to retrieve the server capabilities. On the client side, it can be used to modify the request based on what the server can support. 


* Status codes:
    * 100’s: informational messages
    * 200s: successful
        * 204 No content:  there is no message body in the response.
        * 202 Accepted: the request was accepted but may not include the resource in the response. This is useful for async processing on the server side. The server may choose to send information for monitoring.
        * 205 Reset Content: indicates to the client to reset its document view.
        * 206 Partial Content: indicates that the response only contains partial content. Additional headers indicate the exact range and content expiration information.
    * 300s: redirection
        * 301 Moved Permanently: the resource is now located at a new URL. 
        * 303 See Other: the resource is temporarily located at a new URL. The Location response header contains the temporary URL.
        * 304 Not Modified: the server has determined that the resource has not changed and the client should use its cached copy. This relies on the fact that the client is sending ETag (Enttity Tag) information that is a hash of the content. The server compares this with its own computed ETag to check for modifications.
    * 400s: error
        * 400 Bad Request: the request was malformed.
        * 401 Unauthorized: request requires authentication. The client can repeat the request with the Authorization header. If the client already included the Authorization header, then the credentials were wrong.
        * 403 Forbidden: server has denied access to the resource.
        * 405 Method Not Allowed: invalid HTTP verb used in the request line, or the server does not support that verb.
        * 409 Conflict: the server could not complete the request because the client is trying to modify a resource that is newer than the client's timestamp. Conflicts arise mostly for PUT requests during collaborative edits on a resource.
    * 500’s: server error
        * 501: not implemented
        * 503: service unavailable 


Headers: 
* General headers: applicable for both request and response messages
    * general-header = Cache-Control            
    *                | Connection        
    *                | Date              
    *                | Pragma            
    *                | Trailer           
    *                | Transfer-Encoding 
    *                | Upgrade           
    *                | Via               
    *                | Warning

* the status code is important and tells the client how to interpret the server response. 

* Via header is used in a TRACE message and updated by all intermittent proxies and gateways
* Pragma is considered a custom header and may be used to include implementation-specific headers. The most commonly used pragma-directive is Pragma: no-cache, which really is Cache-Control: no-cacheunder HTTP/1.1. This will be covered in Part 2 of the article.
* The Date header field is used to timestamp the request/response message
* Upgrade is used to switch protocols and allow a smooth transition to a newer protocol.
* Transfer-Encoding is generally used to break the response into smaller parts with the Transfer-Encoding: chunked value. This is a new header in HTTP/1.1 and allows for streaming of response to the client instead of one big payload.



* request specific headers
* response specific headers
* entity headers
